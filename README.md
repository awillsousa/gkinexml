## Program to write and read body stance descripton language


This program aimed to write body stance language, defined by a XML pattern. The user can define a body position, changing specific positions of the avatar body on the screen and, export the data to a specific XML file. The application was developed in Java 8, using Swing components. 

The main goal here its introduce a mark-up language for the description of human postures, taking into account not only the relationship between directly connected body parts, but also between indirectly connected ones, along with some symmetry relations. This effort is taken as part of a bigger project, called Education and monitoring of physical activities through artificial intelligence techniques 3, which aims at the teaching and monitoring of physical activities, specially within the practice of martial arts.
